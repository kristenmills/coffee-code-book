Coffee Table Book of Elegant Code That Looks Nice

## How to Contribute to this Project
All code submissions should be made in a subdirectory under the top-level `code-submissions` directory, accompanied with a README. To submit to that directory, first create a pull-request to the master branch of the project. From there weâ€™ll discuss any comments we have on the code.  
  
Each submission should have information including: author, language, purpose, interesting facts; anything that could be put in a short description on the page in the book.

Theme Submissions should also be submitted with a PR. Submissions should be their own directory in the `theme-submissions` directory. The directory should include a README with a link to the theme/font, and pictures with example code.
