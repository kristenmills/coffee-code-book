## How to Contribute to this Project
All submissions should be made in a subdirectory under the top-level `submissions` directory, accompanied with a README. To submit to that directory, first create a pull-request to the master branch of the project. From there weâ€™ll discuss any comments we have on the code.  
  
Each submission should have information including: author, language, purpose, interesting facts; anything that could be put in a short description on the page in the book.
